# Vulkan Tutorial

This is the source code for the Vulkan tutorial from https://vulkan-tutorial.com, up until the Validation layers tutorial on introducing debug messages. This project is built to be platform agnostic using [https://cmake.org/](CMake) & [https://vcpkg.io/en/](vcpkg).

* CMake makes it easy to configue/build projects with complex dependencies, like Vulkan, GLFW, or GLM.

* VCPKG is a modern C++ package manager.
